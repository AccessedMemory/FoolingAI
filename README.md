The notebook in this repository trains a shallow CNN to classify the MNIST dataset. Then three methods of applying different levels of noise to the test set are investigated to see how it affects the accuracy of the model.

The notebook is self contained as the MNIST dataset is available through Python packages.

The notebook should be run on a Google Colab GPU for the model to train quickly.
